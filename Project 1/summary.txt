All of the tests went well and none of the aspects of the program failed. For the add function, the program was successfully able to add a record to the database when it had nothing in it. It was also able to add a record to the database before and after the initial record. The printAllRecrods function successfully printed out all of these records and successfully printed out the records, or lack of records, each subsequent time it was called. The deleteRecord function was able to delete a record at the beginning, middle, and end of the record chain and gave an error message when a record was unable to be found or when there were no records in the database. When exit was called the records in the database were written to the specified file using the writefile function and were successfully retrieved when the program was started using readfile function. Using a print statement I was able to confirm that the database was null and that the memory was released when the cleanup function was called at the end of the program. When the program was started with the debug option, the program printed out debug information for the functions.
